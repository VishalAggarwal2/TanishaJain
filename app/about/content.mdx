# About Me

Hi, I’m **Tanisha Jain** – an aspiring **Manual Automation & AI Solutions Engineer** who loves turning repetitive, manual processes into reliable, AI-powered automation workflows that dramatically reduce manual work. I combine AI, scripting, and no-code/low-code tools to build solutions that save time and reduce human error.

With hands-on experience in **Python**, **JavaScript**, **n8n**, **Zapier**, **Puppeteer**, and **Selenium**, I design and ship automations that connect APIs, scrape or interact with the web, and trigger the right actions at the right time. My goal is to build AI-assisted systems that feel like an extra team member—not just a script.

## What I Do

- **Email & Workflow Automation**: Build end-to-end automations (like [`n8n` workflows](https://n8n.io/workflows/) and Zapier zaps) that move data between tools, send contextual emails, and remove manual copy‑paste work.
- **Browser Automation**: Use **Puppeteer** and **Selenium** to automate repetitive browser tasks such as data collection, regression checks, and UI flows.
- **AI-Powered Solutions**: Integrate LLMs and AI services into workflows to summarize, classify, or generate content as part of larger automations.
- **Full Stack Foundations**: Use **React/Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **APIs** to build dashboards and interfaces on top of automation pipelines.

## Core Skills

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Automation Platforms**: n8n, Zapier
- **Browser Automation**: Puppeteer, Selenium
- **Web Stack**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Collaboration**: Git/GitHub, REST APIs, JSON, Postman

## Why Work With Me?

- **Automation Mindset**: I always ask, “Can this be automated?” and design reliable systems to make it happen.
- **Attention to Detail**: From edge cases to logging, I care about making automations stable and observable.
- **Continuous Learning**: I actively explore new tools, AI capabilities, and best practices in automation engineering.
- **Collaborative Spirit**: I enjoy working closely with engineers, PMs, and non-technical teams to translate real problems into solutions.
